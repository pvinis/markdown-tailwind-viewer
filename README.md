# a great markdown viewer

### ðŸ”— [md.quad.codes](https://md.quad.codes)

I use Markdown for notes, document outlines, and many more text-centered things.

Using Markdown is great for me as the one writing it and reading it. But when I want to share with others that are not familiar with Markdown or don't want to read it in plain text, I had to convert it to a more readable format.

### Not anymore!

Now I can just use this cool little tool I wrote!

I host my markdown files and then I can link to them using `https://md.quad.codes/<my-markdown-file>`, like the [intro](https://md.quad.codes/intro.md).

Similarly, I have made it support arbitrary urls like the readme of [rn-diff-purge](https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge), so we create this link:

https://md.quad.codes/custom?u=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge/master/README_MAINTAINERS.md

#### Thank you for reading!
